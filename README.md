# 👋Welcome!
If you are looking for an explanation, you are in the right place.
## A little bit about me
Currently a Computer Science major, switched from Electrical Engineering. I enjoy software more than hardware. I hope to one day be able to create custom scripts to use in Unity or as mods for other games.
### Hobbies
- Video games: currently VRCHAT, but I do sometimes play Black Desert Online and Minecraft.
- Movies: Mostly Marvel
- TV: 🗾Japanese TV shows like *Ningen Kansatsu: Monitoring* and *Kamen Rider*
- Anime: Currently watching *In the Land of Leadale*, *Kenja no Desho wo Nanoru Kenja*, *How the Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Season 2*, and *Arifureta Season 2*
- Cooking: 🍛Japanese Curry🍛 mostly, but I also make the Thai dish Nam Tok quite often.

In my spare time, I usually end up recreating superheroes from TV shows, notably *Kamen Rider*, inside Unity, along with their special effects, then uploading it to VRCHAT to enjoy in first person glory.
#### Kamen Rider Chaser
